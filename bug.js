I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I had correctly installed and configured Tailwind, and the classes were being included in my HTML, but they didn't seem to have any visual effect. The problem turned out to be that the Tailwind directives in my `tailwind.config.js` were missing the `content` array.  I was using `purge` which is deprecated and should be replaced with `content`.  After adding the `content` array to point to my template files, the styles were correctly applied.
